    "We highly recommend getting Python and Jupyter to run on your own computer. There are several variable possibilities to get Python and different packages to work on your own computer. If you have not yet installed Python on your computer we recommend Anaconda, https://www.anaconda.com . To install Anaconda, download the most recent Anaconda package and follow the instalation instructions. To view and edit Jupyter notebooks we recommend Jupyter lab. You can start Jupyter lab from the Anaconda launcher.\n",

    "To exchange content between your computer and the GitHub servers without the need for the comando prompt, we recomend GitHub Desktop. To install, follow the instructions and log into your GitHub account. https://desktop.github.com\n",
