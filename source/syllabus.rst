Syllabus
========

Summary
-------
Modern research approaches tightly integrate experimentation with data analysis and mathematical modeling to provide unprecedented insights into the organization and functioning of living systems. This course explores the quantitative basis of major cellular processes and their coordination to form a cohesive physiological entity that is capable of rapid growth and acclimation to changing environments. Weekly lectures will be accompanied by 'dry lab sessions' in which students analyze experimental data sets and discuss the challenges of accomplishing rigorous and reproducible research. As such, students will actively develop a fundamental skill set of quantitative biology which includes knowledge in coding, dynamical systems modeling, and statistics. Assumes basic (but not advanced) familiarity with math, e.g. MATH51. 

Time & Location
---------------
Tuesday and Thursday 9:00 to 10:50 am. All class meetings are in the Sapp Building, room 104.
