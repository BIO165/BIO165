Welcome
=======
Welcome to the website of the BIO65 course. 

We will use this website to present material and links. This site will continue to be available after completion of this course. 

.. The following lines are necessary in RST to populate the side bar. In short,
   you should have each category

   lessons/lesson_1.ipynb

.. note::
    This website was generated using a template provided by Griffin Chure for building academic course (or research) websites. Core of the script is `Sphinx <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/>`, a documentation 
generator using Python. Many of our course materials are developed using Jupyter 
notebooks, making documentation generation a great way to make them searchable without 
worrying about configuring HTML output and integration with other hosting solutions. You can setup similar sites fairly easily, for example for presenting during the presentation phase of this course, or when writing a documentation of your research. 

.. note::
	To make this site a useful resource, we happily consider suggestions to link further sites.
